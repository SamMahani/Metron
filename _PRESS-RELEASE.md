## Métron ##

A simple Metronome.
Making life easier for new drum players.

This metronome helps new drum players gradually increase or decrease their tempo over a specified time.

Current implementations of dynamic tempo change are time-signature-dependent.

Our implementation does not use a time-signature. Rather it implements an algebraic approach to give the user a true sense of gradual tempo increase or decrease.

"As a Daf player, I have always wanted a metronome that affords me the ability to gradually increase tempo. Well, I'm proud to say that Métron now offers this functionality."
  - Sam Mahani

To start using this app, simply select your starting tempo, ending tempo, and the duration.

"Ever since I started using Métron, I have been able to seamlessly increase the tempo!"
